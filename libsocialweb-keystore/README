                    KERNEL KEYRING OBFUSCATION (prototype)

libsocialweb-keystore has the ability to lookup API keys in the linux kernel
keyring. This allows obfuscation and obscurity for loaded API keys. This should
not be seen as a security feature, but rather as an obscurity feature.

To use the kernel keyring, configure libsocialweb with the --with-kernel-keyring
option. Make sure libkeyutils (and development libraries) are installed.

See examples/request-api-key.sh for an example of how to load these keys into
the kernel keyring on demand.
